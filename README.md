I’m a **software engineering researcher** at the [Database Laboratory](https://lbd.udc.es/) of the **University of A Coruña**, where I focus on building **highly variable software systems**. My work spans **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **model-driven engineering**, with a strong emphasis on real-world applicability and efficiency.

My research is centered on creating tools and techniques that make the development of complex software systems more efficient and adaptable. I work with **software product lines**, **urban energy modeling**, **GIS deployment automation**, and **low-code platforms for data visualization**. Over the past years, I’ve been involved in more than **ten R&D projects** funded through competitive public calls, as well as several **technology transfer contracts** with companies in the tech and education sectors—delivering practical solutions with both technical depth and social relevance.

I’ve presented my work at major international conferences like [SPLC](https://www.splc.net/) and [MODELS](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2024), and published in **peer-reviewed journals** such as *SoftwareX*, *Sustainable Cities and Society*, and *Computers & Geosciences*. These publications reflect both **methodological contributions** and **hands-on software implementations**, often targeting challenges in **scientific software** and **adaptive system design**.

In parallel with academic research, I contribute to the development and long-term maintenance of **open-source software** used across academic and industrial settings. My work combines advanced technical skills with collaborative, interdisciplinary experience and a strong commitment to **software reuse**, **sustainability**, and **open science**.
